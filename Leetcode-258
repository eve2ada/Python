'''
 Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has 
 only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, 
return it.

def addDigits(num):
    if num == 0:
        result = 0
    elif num % 9 == 0:
        result = 9
    else:
        result = num % 9
    return result
