'''
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, 
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

    12 + 92 = 82
    82 + 22 = 68
    62 + 82 = 100
    12 + 02 + 02 = 1

    sumList = []
    index = 0
    sumList.append(calculateSum(n))
    while index >= 0:
        temp = calculateSum(sumList[index])
        if temp == 1:
            return True
        elif temp in sumList:
            return False
        else:
            sumList.append(temp)
            index += 1
    

def calculateSum(n):
    sumDigits = 0
    for number in str(n):
        sumDigits += (int(number) ** 2)
    
    return sumDigits
