'''
Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place 
and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place 
with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave 
beyond the new length.

Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of 
nums being 2.
