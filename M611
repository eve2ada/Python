'''
iven an array consists of non-negative integers, your task is to count the number of 
triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths 
of a triangle.

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3

Note:

    The length of the given array won't exceed 1000.
    The integers in the given array are in the range of [0, 1000].
